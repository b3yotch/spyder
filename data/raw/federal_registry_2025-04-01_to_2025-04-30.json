Title and purpose of information collection: Employer's Quarterly Report of Contributions under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act; OMB 3220-0012. Under Section 8 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) (45 U.S.C. 358), the RRB determines the amount of an employer's contribution, primarily on the basis of the RUIA benefits paid, both unemployment and sickness, to the employees of the railroad employer. These experienced-based contributions take into account the frequency, volume, and duration of the employees' unemployment and sickness benefits. Each employer's contribution rate includes a component for administrative expenses as well as a component to cover costs shared by all employers. The regulations prescribing the manner and conditions for remitting the contributions and for adjusting overpayments or underpayments of contributions are contained in 20 CFR 345. RRB Form DC-1, Employer's Quarterly Report of Contributions under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, is used by railroad employers to report and remit their quarterly contributions to the RRB. Employers can use either the manual version of the form or its internet equivalent. One response is requested quarterly of each respondent and completion is mandatory. The RRB proposes the following changes to the manual and electronic versions of Form DC-1: <bullet> Top of page: Changed \"Employer Number\" to \"Employer BA Number\". <bullet> Top of page: Changed \"Calendar Year and Quarter\" to \"Reporting Period (Calendar Year and Quarter)\". <bullet> Field 1: Changed \"Current Reporting Period\" to \"Reporting Period Compensation\". <bullet> Field 2: Changed \"Compensation Adjustments reported on Form BA-4\" to \"Compensation Adjustments--Prior Year Compensation Adjustments Reported on Form(s) BA-4 in the Reporting Period\". <bullet> Field 3: Changed \"Total\" to \"Total Reporting Period Compensation\". <bullet> Field 4: Changed \"Total\" to \"Total Compensation and Corrections\". <bullet> Form instruction: Updated the Paperwork Reduction Act section and instructions to match field name changes to the form.", "document_number": "2025-06952", "type": "Notice", "publication_date": "2025-04-23", "title": "Proposed Collection; Comment Request", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD", "name": "Railroad Retirement Board", "id": 444, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/railroad-retirement-board", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/444", "parent_id": null, "slug": "railroad-retirement-board"}], "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/23/2025-06952/proposed-collection-comment-request", "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2025/04/23/2025-06952.xml", "effective_on": null, "significant": null}, {"abstract": "The Sierra Nevada Region (SN) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) proposes new long-term formula rates to become effective October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2030 for Pacific Alternating Current Intertie (PACI) Point-to-Point (PTP) transmission services.

Since the FAA issued AD 2024-06-02, the manufacturer determined that the compliance time for the DVI can be extended, and repetitive inspections of the centrifugal compressor case must be accomplished. This proposed AD would require performing repetitive DVIs of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, replacing the compressor case if necessary, and sending certain inspection results to the manufacturer, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.

In 2016, EOIR issued a final rule amending the regulations governing the requirements and procedures for the recognition of organizations and the accreditation of those organizations' representatives to represent persons in proceedings before EOIR and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Those regulatory amendments transferred the administration of the Recognition and Accreditation (R&A) Program within EOIR from the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) to the Office of Legal Access Programs (OLAP). In 2019, the R&A Program was transferred by regulation to the Office of Policy (OP), the part of EOIR that oversees OLAP. EOIR proposes to modify JUSTICE/BIA-002 and to change the system number to JUSTICE/EOIR-004 to reflect the transfer of the R&A Program to OP. The last publication of the complete system of records notice was in 1980, prior to the issuance of OMB A-108. As such, EOIR is re-publishing the System of Records Notice for this system, in full. Additionally, the agency's Access EOIR initiative gave rise to the modernization of the Recognition and Accreditation Program application process through the development of the Recognition and Accreditation Access (RAA) system allowing prospective applicants to apply online for recognition or accreditation and online account management of an approved organization.
