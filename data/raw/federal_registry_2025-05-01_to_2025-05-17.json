In particular, the CIT sustained Commerce's remand redetermination calculating a 0.88 percent de minimis subsidy rate for Fontaine, Inc. and its cross-owned affiliates Gestion Natanis Inc., Les Placements Jean-Paul Fontaine Ltee, and Placements Nicolas Fontaine Inc. (collectively, Fontaine) and determination to exclude subject merchandise produced and exported by Fontaine from the CVD order on softwood lumber from Canada. On March 13, 2025, the CIT issued an order severing Fontaine, Inc., et al., v. United States, et al., Ct. No. 19- 00154, (Fontaine v. US) from COALITION. The CIT further issued its judgment and ordered that Fontaine's enjoined entries be liquidated in accordance with the final court decision. On April 18, 2025, pursuant to CIT Rule 60(b)(6), the Court further ordered that Commerce: (1) publish an amended final results of the CVD expedited review with respect to Fontaine that reflects the calculated 0.00 percent cash deposit rate for Fontaine, and (2) ensure that subject entries enjoined in the action are liquidated in accordance with the final court decision, including all appeals, consistent with the requirements of section 516A(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Accordingly, Commerce is issuing these amended final results of CVD expedited review reflecting the zero percent cash deposit rate determined in Commerce's remand redetermination. Moreover, we are confirming that Commerce will also direct CBP to liquidate entries enjoined in this action of softwood lumber produced and exported by Fontaine, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after April 28, 2017, in accordance with the final court decision in this case, including all appeals.", "document_number": "2025-07678", "type": "Notice", "publication_date": "2025-05-05", "title": "Certain Softwood Lumber Products From Canada: Notice of Amended Final Results of Countervailing Duty Expedited Review; Notice of Exclusion From Countervailing Duty Order", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE", "name": "Commerce Department", "id": 54, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/commerce-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/54", "parent_id": null, "slug": "commerce-department"}, {"raw_name": "International Trade Administration", "name": "International Trade Administration", "id": 261, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/international-trade-administration", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/261", "parent_id": 54, "slug": "international-trade-administration"}], "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/05/2025-07678/certain-softwood-lumber-products-from-canada-notice-of-amended-final-results-of-countervailing-duty", "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2025/05/05/2025-07678.xml", "effective_on": null, "significant": null}, {"abstract": "This document amends the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel 12 for channel 28 at Wichita, Kansas in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC (Gray), the licensee of KSCW-DT, Wichita, Kansas.
